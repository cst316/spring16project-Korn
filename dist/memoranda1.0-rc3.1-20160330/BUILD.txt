                            Building HOWTO

================================================================================

Obtaining sourcecode
--------------------

You can obtain the Memoranda source code by the following ways:

	* Download the sourcecode distribution (memoranda-**-src-**.zip) or full
	  distribution (memoranda-**-**.zip) from
	  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/memoranda
	
	* Download the nightly CVS tarball of Memoranda source code from
	  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/memoranda-cvsroot.tar.bz2
	  
	* Checkout source code from SourceForge CVS server by
	  
      $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/memoranda login
      CVS password: (hit enter at the password prompt)
      $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/memoranda checkout
            memoranda
            

Dependencies
------------

The Memoranda depends on some additional third-party libraries which can be 
downloaded as "memoranda-**-libs-**.zip" file. After download, unpack this file 
into the Memoranda home directory (it should create the 'lib/' subdirectory 
there).

Note that you don't need it if you've got the "full" distribution package.


Building the Memoranda from sources
-----------------------------------

For building Memoranda you need Jakarta Ant build tool (v1.5.2 and higher). 
You can download Ant from http://jakarta.apache.org. 

	1) Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to your JDK installation 
      	   directory
	2) Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to Jakarta Ant directory 
	3) Go to the Memoranda home directory
	4) Run 'ant' or 'ant package'

IMPORTANT: $ANT_HOME/bin directory must be on your system PATH.

You can also use the following build commands:
	
	'ant dist-bin' - Create the binary distribution package 
	'ant dist-src' - Create the source distribution package
	'ant dist-deps' - Create the dependencies distribution package 
	'ant dist-full' - Create the full distribution package
	'ant dist' - Create all distribution packages
	'ant clean' - Delete the 'build' subdirectory
	'ant clean-dist' - Delete the 'dist' subdirectory

Compile options:

	debug 
	Indicates whether source should be compiled with debug information; 
	(on/off, defaults to off)
			
	debuglevel 
	Keyword list to be appended to the -g command-line switch. Legal values 
	are none or a comma-separated list of the following keywords: lines, vars, and 
	source. If debuglevel is not specified, by default, nothing will be appended
	to -g. If debug is not turned on, this attribute will be ignored. 
	
	optimize
	Indicates whether source should be compiled with optimization; (on/off, 
	defaults to off)
	
	deprecation
	Indicates whether source should be compiled with deprecation information; 
	(on/off, defaults to off).

To set an option, use the "-D" commandline parameter, e.g.

	ant -Ddebug=on
