- Resizing of dialogs conform to the XP-style look&feel

                         Memoranda 1.0a-20030930 release:
===================================================================================

The project has been moved from jnotes.sf.net. The current version was renamed 
to "Memoranda 1.0 alpha".

===================================================================================

     For the ones that are helping with the translation to other languages ...

    - Use an UTF-enabled text editor to edit the files. JEdit 4.1 Final (editor 
          written in Java) is a good choice.
    - use UTF-8 encoding instead of your default system codepage.
    - UTF-8 has support for multi-languages, so also special chars.
    - Be sure to choose the UTF-8 encoding to avoid problems with
      special characters that needs to be displayed.

       !!! If you do not follow this tip this can give unexpected results !!!
